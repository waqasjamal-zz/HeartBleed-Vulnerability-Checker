I have modified this script to take any input url file. Check it for valid tld from provided set of urls, create unique set and parse that to the script for checking heartbleed vulnerability.

#Update
Script now only clean URL instead of checking for valid tld. 
Output Improved as well.  

#Installation Guide
You do no need to install anything extra in order to test this script

# Usage example: 
python check_heartbleed.py filename 10



#Tasks to do
 1) Include IP in the list as well (It should be working now)
 2) Multi threaded code
 3) Try URL Parse instead of tld library (Done)
